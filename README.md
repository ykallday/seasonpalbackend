# SeasonPal Backend

## Overview
The SeasonPal website was designed to encourage people to eat seasonally! Aside from the fact that seasonal produce tends to be fresher, and more delicious and nutritious, eating seasonally is a great way to support local produce and local farming. Use this app to plan your shopping list before attending a Farmers Market or grocery store, or while your planning your meals. Eating seasonally has never been easier! Plus, check out the resources section to learn more.

### 1. Entity Relation Diagram
I created an ERD diagram using [Draw.io!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a4VaOTSJD28_XgbcRlcE_Gw0Bx5cEWa3/view?usp=sharing "Draw.io"). My database will feature 2 primary models, along with 2 additional models to handle user information.
### 2. Component Hierarchy Diagram & Wireframe
I created a CHD & wireframe using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0NCkV4tbvh7lWAi9vA1jb3/seasonpal?node-id=0%3A1&t=e2TBzBR1XyGbKnwE-1).
