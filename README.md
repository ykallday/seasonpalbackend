## Overview
The SeasonPal website was designed to encourage people to eat seasonally! Aside from the fact that seasonal produce tends to be fresher, and more delicious and nutritious, eating seasonally is a great way to support local produce and local farming, as well as help the environment. Use this app to plan your shopping list before attending a Farmers Market or grocery store, or while you're planning your meals. Eating seasonally has never been easier!

### 1. Entity Relation Diagram
I created an ERD diagram using [Draw.io!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a4VaOTSJD28_XgbcRlcE_Gw0Bx5cEWa3/view?usp=sharing "Draw.io"). 
### 2. Component Hierarchy Diagram & Wireframe
I created a CHD & wireframe using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0NCkV4tbvh7lWAi9vA1jb3/seasonpal?node-id=0%3A1&t=e2TBzBR1XyGbKnwE-1).
### 3. Information Gathering
Almost all of my data came from the Seasonal Food Guide website, which is a great resource and my overall inspiration.

### 4. Database
I built my database using Django / Python, and I deployed it using Render.
### 5. Front End
I built my Front End application using React.js and TailwindCSS.

### 6. Deployment / Live View
I deployed my front end using Netlify.
### 7. Future Improvements
There are many improvements I'd like to make, and new additions.
In the near future, I hope to:
- Create a view that allows user to see the full seasonality of an item within user's location
- Share location based resources
- Complete User JWT Authentication / Authorization
In the further future, I hope to:
- Reconfigure my database
- Add more produce
- Foster a supportive community
